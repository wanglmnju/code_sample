# Code Samples

This repository contains selected code samples demonstrating my programming skills in Python, Fortran, and C++. These examples reflect my experience in scientific computing, data analysis.

## Highlights

### Python: Oscillation Strength from Phonon Spectrum
This notebook demonstrates how to compute the oscillation strength based on a given phonon spectrum. It involves:
- Reading phonon mode data
- Calculating contributions from different vibrational modes
- Visualizing spectral features and derived quantities

### Fortran: Monte Carlo Simulation of 2D XY Model
This program simulates a two-dimensional XY model using Monte Carlo sampling. It includes:
- Initialization of a spin lattice
- Implementation of the Metropolis algorithm
- Measurement of thermodynamic observables over simulation steps

### C++: Scattering Term Calculation Using Hamiltonian
This C++ code computes scattering terms using a predefined Hamiltonian. It features:
- Matrix element computations
- Quantum state transitions
- Basic linear algebra operations for physical system modeling
